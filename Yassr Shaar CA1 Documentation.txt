Documentation:
The shell is written in Unix bash and uses python for certain commands such as date and User Details. The purpose of this shell script is to give certain functionality to a user and make some commands easier to use. This shell script provides convinience and provides information for the commands a user can use help.
Downloading the Shell file and the Python file and place them in the same directory. preferably the home directory of user test 

Then give permision to the shell file using the following command :
---------------------------------------------
chmod +x /home/test/ca1
---------------------------------------------

finally I used this command to allow the shell script to run as default by making it take the place of /bin/bash as the default.
---------------------------------------------
sudo usermod -s /home/test/ca1 test
---------------------------------------------

once the shell script is running use the help command to display all of the commands and a short description of them :
help - displays available commands
pw | pwd -  Displays the working Directory
ifc -  short for ifconfig. Displays Interface Configuration
dt -  Displays the Date
ud -  Displays the user information and inode
hist - Displays command history
stop -  Ends the shell script and logs the user out
clear - Clears the screen
